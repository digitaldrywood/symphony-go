# Configuration

Detent has two configuration layers:

- `global.yaml` selects projects and controls host-wide runtime settings.
- Each project has a checked-in `detent.yaml` machine contract, with optional
  machine-local overrides in `detent.local.yaml`. The project contract can also
  live in legacy `WORKFLOW.md` YAML frontmatter.

This page is the single reference for both configuration layers. Project
configuration is documented below after the host-wide settings.

For instance backend/route inheritance and the opt-in `sol_first` model-selection
preset, see [Instance agent defaults](multi-project.md#instance-agent-defaults-and-sol-first-selection).

## Terminal attempt recovery

Set `recovery.terminal_attempt_retry_limit` in `detent.yaml` or
`detent.local.yaml` to control recovery from consecutive terminal attempts
without a pushed work product or linked pull request:

```yaml
recovery:
  terminal_attempt_retry_limit: 0
```

The default is `3`. The value preserves the existing consecutive-failure
threshold for values of `2` or greater; `1` explicitly permits one recovery
attempt, and `0` disables automatic recovery for a qualifying failure.

| Setting | Failure 1 | Failure 2 | Failure 3 | Recovery after parking |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `0` | Blocked | No automatic attempt | No automatic attempt | Operator reviews the failure and moves the issue to Todo |
| `1` | Todo; one recovery attempt | Blocked | No attempt before recovery from parking | Existing breaker cooldown |
| `3` (default) | Todo | Todo | Blocked | Existing breaker cooldown |

Thus `1` and `2` both park on the second qualifying failure. Higher values
park on that numbered failure. Negative values are rejected. This compatibility
rule keeps the existing default at two redispatches before parking.

The zero policy persists an operator-owned hold, including the latest failure
evidence. It also enforces the hold from the current completion when saving the
attempt fails or no durable attempt record is available. Restarting Detent or waiting for the breaker cooldown does not release
that hold. If the tracker rejects the Blocked transition, Detent holds the issue
locally and retries that transition during reconciliation without starting a worker.
Changing the setting alone does not authorize release of an existing
operator-owned hold. Retry counts are reconstructed from durable issue attempt
history after restart; successful attempts and pushed work reset the sequence.
Service-restart recovery remains resumable and does not consume this limit.

Durable provider capacity, GitHub REST capacity, and forge availability waits
retain their existing handling and do not consume generic terminal retries.
Transient overload failures remain qualifying terminal failures. Workspace
preparation retains its separate fixed threshold of three failures. This policy
is independent of automatic promotion, validators, and Rework limits.

`detent doctor` reports the effective setting, the qualifying failure on which
Detent parks, and whether parking requires external review or uses cooldown
recovery. Local overlays preserve an explicit zero.

## Repository policy with Hub execution

Connecting a project to Hub preserves its repository definition. The customer
host resolves the existing files and an administrator explicitly approves the
resulting descriptor. Hub never supplies replacement workflow prose or rewrites
repository settings. Use `detent hub policy inspect --config /path/global.yaml
--project orders` to review the resolved metadata before approval.

Configuration precedence and authorization are applied in this order:

| Order | Layer | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Parser defaults | Existing defaults and legacy compatibility are unchanged. |
| 2 | Project definition anchor | `projects[].workflow` selects the definition directory, including an external root. `detent.yaml` plus prompt-only `WORKFLOW.md` use schema 1; legacy frontmatter remains supported. Mixed structured authority is rejected. No competing checkout file is searched. |
| 3 | Machine overlays | Existing `detent.local.yaml` and `WORKFLOW.local.md` rules apply: mappings merge, explicit scalars/sequences replace, supported empty/false values clear, and local prose appends. |
| 4 | Host configuration | Existing flags/environment/global precedence, identity, paths, authorization filters, pool/backend limits, budgets and host ceilings remain enforced on customer infrastructure. Repository requirements cannot increase host permissions or capacity. |
| 5 | Explicit Hub approval | The complete resolved policy must match an administrator-approved descriptor for this repository or native organization/project. Approval authorizes that exact effective definition, including its local overrides; it does not override its gates. Missing, stale or contradictory policy denies dispatch. |
| 6 | Run pin | Claims atomically pin the approved policy. The customer runner rechecks approval before dispatch, claim adoption and renewal, and checks its loaded workflow before credentials or workspace creation. |

Use an administrator-selected `workflow_ref` to read shared files from a trusted
Git commit. The loader resolves the ref once and reads shared files at that
commit; edits to the working branch do not change it. Local overlays still need
approval. An external definition is authorized by reviewing its resolved content
digest through the same approval command. Approvals must be performed outside
the implementation worker; do not give workers the Hub administrator credential.

`hub policy inspect` operates locally and prints schema 1, the source revision,
source/configuration digests, a content-derived `policy_id`, selected runner
requirements and bounded gate metadata. The digest covers the effective
configuration and workflow; it does not expose the content. Workflow prose,
commands, local paths, credentials, environment values, approval-label text and
check names remain on customer infrastructure. A plan stop is represented by a
digest, while required checks are represented by their count. Custom gate and
validator settings still contribute to the effective configuration digest.

After reviewing the files and descriptor, an administrator runs:

```sh
detent hub policy approve --config /path/global.yaml --project orders
```

The command reads `DETENT_HUB_ADMIN_TOKEN` (or `--admin-token-env`) and uploads
only the descriptor. Replacement requires `--expected-policy-id policy_...` to
prevent a stale approval from overwriting another administrator's decision.
Changing effective files, permitted local adjustments, resolved environment
values or the trusted source revision requires a new reviewed approval. Each
host must resolve the approved effective definition; another host's descriptor
is not permission to use different local settings.

Active leases retain their policy, and Hub refuses a replacement while they
remain active. Finish or cancel those attempts, approve the new descriptor, and
restart the customer Detent process to adopt it. Invalid or unapproved reloads
retain the last-known-good configuration and report an actionable error. A
running process retains its policy even if a new descriptor is approved. Resumed
provider sessions must match the policy stored with their original attempt,
including after Hub is disabled; missing or mismatched recovery identities are
rejected. Automatic thread reuse falls back to a fresh attempt under the current
policy. Standalone sessions that never had a Hub policy retain legacy recovery.

Administrators can revoke the current approval through the policy API. This
immediately denies claims, lease renewal and new run events. Worker heartbeat
checks observe the revocation and stop work through existing lease-loss handling;
release remains available. Historical revisions and lease pins are retained.

Plan-review stops, gate kinds, human approval, automatic-promotion opt-outs,
CI/check requirements, validators, security audits and merge methods remain
project-specific. Two repositories sharing a runner retain separate approvals
and gates. Hub approval is not a human plan/PR approval. GitHub's repository
automatic-merge setting remains owned by that repository; onboarding inspection
reports it without changing it. Host restrictions and revoked authority win over
an approved policy or a Hub allowance. Hub has no browser setting that silently
relaxes repository policy.

Effective policy appears in project settings, work-attempt receipts, health
workflow provenance and `detent doctor` output. Policy mismatches leave work
waiting without creating an execution attempt or consuming execution retries.

### Named runner requirements

Declare profiles in the existing shared or legacy configuration and select one
with `runners.profile`:

```yaml
runners:
  profile: build
  profiles:
    build:
      required_tags: [linux, go]
      machine_id: machine_0123456789abcdef
      runner_id: runner_0123456789abcdef
```

Profiles and tags use ASCII letters/digits with `-`, `_` and `.`, up to 64
characters. Tags are trimmed, lowercased, sorted and deduplicated; profile names
must already be lowercase. At most 32 profiles and 32 tags per profile are
accepted. Selectors are optional stable IDs with `machine_` or `runner_` prefixes;
display names are not selectors. Every required tag and every explicit selector
must match. Unknown selectors never widen to another host. An empty profile
selection has no extra routing requirements. Explicit empty lists and selector
strings in local overlays retain their existing clearing semantics and require
approval as part of the effective definition.

Profiles declare requirements, never enrollment or capabilities. Machine
registration still happens on an authorized physical host. The Hub checks
machine pins and matches runner IDs only against authenticated enrolled runner
identities. Legacy worker tokens cannot assert an enrolled runner ID. Required
tags return `selector_no_match` until the authorized tag-placement deliverable
#2185 is available. Self-reported machine capabilities never satisfy privileged
tags. See [runner enrollment](hub-api.md) for the separate host authorization path.

## Host configuration

At startup, Detent resolves `global.yaml` in this order. The first matching rule wins.

| Order | Rule | Path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `--config <path>` | Direct file path from the CLI flag |
| 2 | `CONFIG=<file>` | Direct file path from the environment |
| 3 | `CONFIG_HOME=<dir>` | `<dir>/global.yaml` |
| 4 | `os.UserConfigDir()` | `<config-dir>/detent/global.yaml` |
| 5 | Legacy home config | `~/.detent/global.yaml` |

`os.UserConfigDir()` maps to `%AppData%\detent\global.yaml` on Windows, `~/Library/Application Support/detent/global.yaml` on macOS, and `~/.config/detent/global.yaml` on Linux while honoring `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`.

`DETENT_CONFIG` and `DETENT_HOME` remain deprecated fallbacks for one release. Detent uses `CONFIG_HOME` instead of `HOME` because `HOME` is standard process state, not Detent configuration.

If no global config is found, Detent keeps the single-project fallback and looks for `WORKFLOW.md` in the current working directory. Use `detent config path` to print the resolved config path and the rule that selected it.

Runtime settings resolve in this order: explicit flag, environment variable,
`global.yaml`, then built-in default.

| Setting | Flag | Environment | `global.yaml` key | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Environment | `--env` | `ENV`, then `DETENT_ENV` | `env` | `prod` |
| Log level | `--log-level` | `LOG_LEVEL`, then `DETENT_LOG_LEVEL` | `log_level` | `info` |
| Log max size | | `LOG_MAX_SIZE_BYTES`, then `DETENT_LOG_MAX_SIZE_BYTES` | `log_max_size_bytes` | `52428800` |
| Log backups | | `LOG_MAX_BACKUPS`, then `DETENT_LOG_MAX_BACKUPS` | `log_max_backups` | `5` |
| GitHub token | | `GITHUB_TOKEN` | `github_token` | required for GitHub projects |
| API token | | `DETENT_API_TOKEN` | `api_token` | open on loopback, fail closed on non-loopback |
| Loopback peer read trust | | | `trust_loopback_peer_read` | `false` |
| Private dashboard URL | | | `dashboard_access` | disabled |
| Hub scheduler | | | `client.hub_url` | disabled |
| Hub worker token | | `DETENT_HUB_TOKEN` | `client.token_env` names the environment variable | required when Hub scheduling is enabled |
| tmux window status | | `$TMUX` detection | `ops.tmux_window_status` | enabled inside tmux |
| Web port | `--port` | `PORT` | `port` | `4000` |
| Instance name | | | `instance_name` | short hostname |
| Health webhook | | | `notifications.health.webhook.url` | disabled |
| Health notification debounce | | | `notifications.health.debounce_seconds` | `300` |
| Health webhook timeout | | | `notifications.health.webhook.timeout_ms` | `5000` |
| Automatic update checks | | | `update.auto_check_enabled` | `false` |
| Update check interval | | | `update.check_interval_hours` | `6` |
| Automatic update apply when idle | | | `update.auto_apply_enabled` | `false` |
| Maximum automatic update deferral | | | `update.max_deferral_hours` | `6` |

Automatic apply waits for an idle runtime until `update.max_deferral_hours`
elapses, then pauses new dispatches and lets in-flight attempts finish within
their configured session ceilings before applying and restarting. Add
`[detent-critical]` to a GitHub release body to bypass the idle wait and start
that drain immediately.

The web host resolves from `--host`, then the first registered workflow's
`server.host`, then the built-in `127.0.0.1` default. It is not a top-level
`global.yaml` key.

### Host pressure admission

On Linux, Detent refreshes Pressure Stall Information (PSI) at admission time,
subject to each signal's configured poll interval. Pressure above any
configured threshold holds new dispatches; it does not cancel or reap agents
that are already running.

```yaml
global:
  memory:
    max_agent_rss_bytes: 8589934592
    pressure_some_avg60_threshold: 10
    poll_interval_ms: 1000
  io:
    pressure_full_avg10_threshold: 5
    degraded_max_concurrent_agents: 0
    poll_interval_ms: 1000
  cpu:
    pressure_some_avg10_threshold: 80
    degraded_max_concurrent_agents: 0
    poll_interval_ms: 1000
```

`degraded_max_concurrent_agents` is an opt-in host-wide progress floor for IO
and CPU pressure. Its default of `0` preserves the conservative hard stop. Set
it to `1` to allow one worker across all named pools while that signal remains
constrained. If IO and CPU pressure are active together, the lower configured
floor wins. The pressure ceiling only blocks new admissions; it never preempts
running workers, and pool, project/state, worker-host, startup pacing, and
backend limits can reduce capacity further.

A guard engages only above its configured threshold. Once engaged, IO and CPU
guards stay constrained until the measured average falls to 80% of the trigger
threshold, which prevents dispatch from flapping when PSI hovers around the
boundary. For example, an IO threshold of `5` engages above `5` and recovers at
or below `4`.

The defaults shown above are starting points, not universal safe values. With
the default degraded capacity of `0`, the sample IO threshold of `5` is a
fleet-wide hard stop whenever IO `full avg10` stays above 5%, including when an
unrelated host process creates the pressure. IO `full` is the strongest build
host signal because it measures time when every non-idle task is stalled on IO.
CPU uses `some`, because system-level CPU `full` is defined to report zero.
Memory `some` remains useful for reclaim and swap pressure, but a compile-heavy
host can be IO- or CPU-saturated while memory PSI stays at zero. See the
[Linux PSI interface](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/accounting/psi.html)
for the kernel definitions.

Treat configured pool capacity as the hard ceiling and use PSI as the dynamic
admission brake. Before enabling a low threshold, observe `/proc/pressure/io`
and `/proc/pressure/cpu` during representative Detent and unrelated compile,
test, browser, database, and media workloads. Calibrate the trigger above the
host's acceptable sustained baseline, then lower it if the interactive host
becomes unresponsive before the guard engages. Raising the hard ceiling based
only on free memory can overload a build host.

The ten-second IO and CPU windows respond faster than the sixty-second memory
window. Keep `global.startup.jitter_seconds` and `max_spawn_per_second`
conservative enough for those averages to react during service startup; PSI
then constrains and restores admission as contention changes. On systems without PSI,
or when a pressure file cannot be read, Detent fails open and reports the
unsupported or unavailable signal rather than inventing a zero reading.

`detent state`, `/api/v1/state`, `/health`, and the Health dashboard expose the
current values, thresholds, read errors, configured degraded capacity,
effective pressure capacity, constraint start time and duration, and whether
each signal is holding dispatch under `memory_pressure`, `io_pressure`, and
`cpu_pressure`. Durable scheduler decisions include pressure capacity, usage,
availability, reason, and duration. Work-attempt capacity snapshots include the
active pressure capacity, reason, and duration.

When Detent starts inside tmux, it renames the current window to a compact
running, ready, waiting, and blocked count summary. It restores the original
name on clean shutdown. Set `ops.tmux_window_status: false` to disable this
behavior; Detent never invokes tmux when `$TMUX` is absent.

Use `github_token: gh` in `global.yaml` to resolve the token from
`gh auth token` at startup. Literal token values also work but should not be
committed. `github_token: gh-auth`, `${gh auth token}`, and
`$(gh auth token)` are accepted aliases. If neither `GITHUB_TOKEN` nor
`github_token` is set, Detent falls back to existing per-workflow
`tracker.api_key` handling.

Set `trust_loopback_peer_read: true` to grant tokenless read-scope API access
to direct loopback TCP peers even when Detent binds a non-loopback address or
has an `api_token`. The setting hot-reloads and applies only to `GET` routes;
admin routes and mutations still require credentials. Authentication uses only
the request's direct peer address and never trusts forwarded-client headers.
Do not enable this setting when a reverse proxy runs on the same host: every
request relayed by that proxy has a loopback direct peer, including requests
that originally came from remote clients.

Use `instance_name` to distinguish browser tabs and the dashboard navbar when
several Detent instances are open at once. Detent resolves the display name
from the first non-empty value in this order: top-level `instance_name` in
`global.yaml`, `global.identity.name`, the short hostname, then empty. In
single-project fallback mode without `global.yaml`, workflow top-level
`identity.name` is used before the short hostname. Names are trimmed, must be a
single line, and are capped at 40 characters in the web UI.

Configure `client.hub_url` to move candidate discovery and claiming to a Detent
Hub. The machine registers its identity, project and pool capabilities,
capacity, operating system, architecture, and binary version. It then
heartbeats while polling the Hub and renewing fenced work leases. The token is
read from the environment variable named by `client.token_env` in legacy mode;
the token is never stored in the configuration file. For scoped native runners,
use `client.identity_file` instead: an absolute path to the private host-generated
identity created by `detent hub runner init` and enrolled with `detent hub runner
enroll`. The client renews this credential automatically. Its organization,
machine ID and explicit native projects must match enrollment. See
[runner onboarding and migration](hub-api.md#scoped-runner-onboarding).

Enrolled native runners can opt into provider-aware dispatch with
`client.provider_capacity_file`, an absolute path to a bounded JSON report file.
The runner reads it on heartbeats and again before starting provider work. See
[provider capacity reports](hub-api.md#provider-capacity-reports) for its safe
schema, shared-account declarations and reservation semantics. This setting does
not change backend credentials, model routes, effort defaults or fallback policy.

```yaml
client:
  hub_url: https://hub.example.com
  token_env: DETENT_HUB_TOKEN
  machine_id: build-mac-01
  display_name: Build Mac 01
  capacity: 4
  heartbeat_interval_seconds: 30
  lease_ttl_seconds: 90
  request_timeout_ms: 10000
```

In legacy mode, `machine_id` defaults to the configured global identity, instance
name, or hostname. Enrolled mode uses the immutable host-generated machine ID.
`capacity` defaults to `global.max_concurrent_agents`. The heartbeat
interval must be shorter than the lease TTL. Hub outages mark project refresh
health degraded and back off with the normal scheduling loop; they do not
consume issue retry, no-progress, or work-failure budgets. GitHub remains in
use for event ingestion, reconciliation, write-back, and fresh safety checks,
but the scheduling claim cycle does not depend on a GitHub read.

Native issue projects use `tracker.kind: hub_native` in their existing repository
workflow configuration. In `global.yaml`, bind each local project ID to its stable
Hub project ID and organization:

```yaml
client:
  hub_url: https://hub.example.com
  token_env: DETENT_HUB_TOKEN
  organization_id: org_example
  native_projects:
    example: prj_example
```

Replace the example IDs with IDs returned by the Hub. The token needs explicit
grants for the mapped projects. Native issue creation, full-body refresh,
discussion, history and scheduling use the Hub v2 API without GitHub issue
networking. Native startup requires the mapping and negotiated capabilities;
there is no fallback scheduler. The [Hub API](hub-api.md#native-collaboration-protocol)
documents project provisioning, workflow states and the typed operations.
Repository workflow files and machine-local overrides keep their existing paths.

Health notifications deliver fleet and project needs-attention transitions to
one generic webhook. They are disabled when
`notifications.health.webhook.url` is absent, preserving the silent default.
Configure the host-wide channel in `global.yaml`:

```yaml
notifications:
  health:
    debounce_seconds: 300
    webhook:
      url: https://alerts.example.com/detent
      headers:
        Authorization: Bearer replace-me
      timeout_ms: 5000
```

The five-minute default debounce applies independently to entry and recovery.
Project identities are stable per project and cause, currently
`ci_unavailable` and `dispatch_stall`; a separate fleet identity represents
the aggregate transition while any project cause remains active. A flap that
clears before the debounce expires emits neither entry nor recovery. Once an
entry is emitted, exactly one recovery is emitted after the identity remains
healthy for the debounce window.

Webhook payloads use event name `detent.health.transition` and include a stable
event ID, host and instance names, scope, optional project ID, entered state,
causes, optional wait reasons, and entry timestamps. Delivery state and pending
events are stored in the runtime SQLite database before sending, so a restart
does not re-fire active conditions or discard unsent transitions. Failed sends
retry at most five times with exponential backoff starting at 30 seconds and
capped at 15 minutes. Every failure is logged and appears in
`health_notification_failures` on `/health`; `detent doctor` reports both
retrying and exhausted deliveries. Notification configuration changes require
a restart. Treat configured headers as secrets and keep host-specific values
out of checked-in project configuration.

Automatic update checks are host-specific and disabled by default. When
enabled, Detent persists the last check and schedules the next jittered check
from that timestamp, so restarts preserve the remaining delay and overdue
checks run promptly. The six-hour default keeps release uptake within the same
day while using about four GitHub requests per host per day. Detent reports the
last check, available or applied version, and next check on `/health` and the
Health dashboard. `detent doctor` surfaces the last and next check times,
reports whether the host is opted in, and suggests enabling checks when it is
not. Automatic apply remains off unless explicitly enabled and only replaces
release-installer binaries; other install sources remain notification-only.
When work attempts are active, Detent shows the pending version in the web and
terminal dashboards and waits for the next fleet-wide idle window before
applying it. An operator can instead confirm immediate apply from the web
notification. A successful apply uses the normal graceful drain path, then
re-executes the replaced binary on POSIX systems or exits cleanly for an
external supervisor to restart it on other platforms.

`detent doctor` prints the resolved runtime values and their sources, with the
GitHub token redacted.

## Choose a starting point

- [`config.example.yaml`](../config.example.yaml) is the smallest working
  project config.
- [`config.annotated.yaml`](../config.annotated.yaml) is a realistic GitHub
  setup with explanations beside each deliberate choice.
- The [worked multi-project configuration](examples/multi-project/README.md)
  pairs an annotated host config with two complete project configs and explains
  the operator rationale behind their scheduling and isolation choices.
- [`config.reference.yaml`](../config.reference.yaml) contains every supported
  project key. It is fully commented so you can copy only what you need.

Keep `detent.yaml` portable and checked in. Put machine-specific paths or
secrets in `detent.local.yaml`, a credential reference, or host configuration.
The local file overlays the shared file recursively and is not a second,
independent configuration.

## How the subsystems fit together

### Identity, tracker, and polling

`identity` names the Detent persona that owns work. `tracker` connects that
persona to GitHub, Linear, an embedded SQLite board, or the in-memory tracker.
The tracker declares active, observed, and terminal workflow states; state maps,
transition automation, admission, planning, stop behavior, and routing all
refer back to those names. `polling` controls how often Detent refreshes the
tracker when no event gives it a fresher signal. Its
`refresh_failure_threshold` controls how many consecutive failures after a
successful refresh promote project and fleet health to `needs_attention`; a
project whose first refresh fails needs attention immediately.

Choose exactly one GitHub status source: ProjectV2, the repository issue
`Status` field, or repository labels. `dependency_auto_unblock`,
`blocked_recovery`, and `blocker_auto_promote` are opt-in tracker automations:
the first advances work whose dependencies cleared, the second revives
agent-recoverable PR maintenance, and the third promotes blockers when they
enter configured states.

GitHub and Linear trackers also receive a default Statuspage base URL through
`tracker.status_page_url`; set that key to override the provider endpoint.
Detent follows redirects and polls the unauthenticated Statuspage summary and
unresolved-incident feeds at a low-frequency baseline, increasing freshness
only while a Detent-observed `tracker_unavailable` condition is active. These
feeds decorate health output only: malformed, slow, or unreachable status
pages never create a condition or influence dispatch and recovery. Statuspage
incident webhooks are a possible future optimization, not part of the current
polling integration.

The tracker setting `github_rest_min_remaining_reserve` is an absolute reserve
for the REST `core` resource (default `1000`). It does not reserve requests in
smaller resources such as `search`; those resources still enforce GitHub's
primary and secondary rate limits and shared backoff. Recovery probes,
reserve diagnostics, and scheduler lookup gates use the same resource rule.
The aggregate REST quota snapshot retains core capacity; resource-specific
budgets continue to report search usage separately. Responses without a resource
name retain the core reserve for compatibility. No configuration migration or
new setting is required; the worker's separate core-budget policy is unchanged.

### Workspace, deliverable, and worker placement

`workspace` controls isolation, source and output roots, branch creation, cache
sharing, and cleanup. `deliverable` selects pull requests or file artifacts and
their review destination. `worker` distributes sessions across optional SSH
hosts; per-state and global concurrency limits remain under `agent`.

GitHub-capable workers never inherit `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_TOKEN`, their
enterprise variants, or the host's GitHub CLI configuration. Leave
`worker.github_token` empty to run workers with no GitHub credential policy.
Set it to `gh` to resolve `gh auth token` in the Detent process and copy only
the resolved token into the worker's isolated `GH_CONFIG_DIR`. An environment
reference remains available when permission or revocation isolation is useful:

```yaml
worker:
  github_token: gh
  github_token_resolution_timeout_ms: 15000
  github_rest_min_remaining_reserve: 1250
  github_rest_poll_interval_ms: 60000
```

The token-resolution timeout applies to each `gh auth token` invocation. Detent
tries the command up to three times with short backoff before recording a
same-attempt infrastructure wait; these failures do not consume issue attempt
or failure-breaker budgets. Increase the timeout when the host credential store
can legitimately take longer than 15 seconds.

After resolving `gh`, Detent classifies an exact orchestrator token or any token
that resolves to the same GitHub user as `shared_budget`: GitHub's primary REST
limit is per user, so a second token changes permissions and revocation without
creating another rate-limit pool. Shared-pool telemetry uses
`consumer: shared_pool` and reports usage attribution as indeterminate rather
than assigning the pool's global usage to workers. A different GitHub user or
App installation is `distinct_principal`, the true rate-limit-isolation mode.

The default worker reserve is 1250, above the default orchestrator dispatch
floor of 1000. Shared-mode workers therefore brake first so dispatch can
continue. Detent probes the worker credential at launch and no more often than
the configured interval, and stops or refuses a worker at its reserve. Keep
literal tokens out of checked-in project files.

`workpad.structured_only` requires machine-readable workpad status instead of
accepting legacy narrative signals. `dependencies.source` chooses whether
native tracker dependencies, merged pull requests, or both determine
readiness.

### Agents, backends, and routing

`agent` is the orchestration policy: concurrency, turn and session limits,
retry brakes, spend limits, shutdown, dispatch priority, automatic promotion,
state-specific instructions, learned context, skill drafts, and follow-up
work. `agents.backends` defines pluggable Codex or Claude Code processes, while
`agents.routes` selects a backend and model by role or issue selector.

`codex` is the legacy/default Codex backend configuration and remains the
fallback when `agents.backends` is empty. A Codex backend inherits omitted
values from it. Claude Code backend options are interpreted only when the
backend `kind` is `claude_code`.

Implementation workers on automatically owned Git branches request a bounded
recovery checkpoint when a duration, turn, or no-progress limit stops them.
`agent.checkpoint_interval_ms` also enables periodic checkpoints; `0` disables
the periodic trigger. Each checkpoint allows up to two minutes for a read-only
worker to select reviewed issue files and for Detent to commit and publish them
with lease and remote checks. Periodic checkpoints retain the session deadline
and accumulated budget usage. Identical work does not create new commits.

Checkpoint publication may associate a draft PR and never satisfies completion,
review, or CI gates. If delivery is unavailable, the owned workspace remains
recoverable. Its Git metadata contains `detent-checkpoint.json`, written before
worker execution, so an interrupted or killed worker does not imply that a
checkpoint epilogue ran. Human branches and backends without the handshake
continue to rely on local workspace recovery.

`agent.auto_promote` and `gate` work together. Auto-promotion decides when an
item may leave its source state; the gate decides whether CI, automated review,
human approval, a validator, or an artifact status is sufficient. `plan`
optionally inserts a plan-review stop before implementation.

### Operations, budgets, and observability

`server` controls the project dashboard bind and Kanban mutation policy.
`active_hours` optionally limits new agent dispatches to recurring weekday and
wall-clock spans in a required IANA timezone. Use window values such as
`Mon-Fri 22:00-06:00`; ranges that end before their start wrap past
midnight, and `00:00-24:00` covers a full day. A project entry in `global.yaml`
overrides `global.active_hours`, and either host-local value overrides the
project's checked-in setting. Window close drains existing agents instead of
stopping them.

Detent evaluates membership on each scheduler tick, preserving local
wall-clock hours through daylight-saving changes and restarts. Spring forward
can shorten a wrapping window by one hour, while fall back can lengthen it by
one hour. `detent doctor` previews opening and closing times in both the named
timezone and UTC. A temporary `detent resume <id> --for <duration>` override
admits work outside the window until its persisted expiry; manual pause remains
the stronger, independent gate.

`observability` controls dashboard refresh, efficiency anomaly thresholds, and
optional OTLP export. `budget` is the project-wide spend policy;
`agent.budget` can further constrain agent sessions. `release` enables
release-readiness automation after merged work accumulates.

`observability.stranded_active_threshold_seconds` controls when Health and
`detent doctor` report an issue that remains in `In Progress` without a live
worker and when Detent recovers it automatically. Issues with an open pull
request or recoverable workspace work move to `Rework`; issues confirmed to
have no recovery artifacts move to `Todo`. Detent holds the issue in place
when artifact evidence is unavailable. The default is 600 seconds, which
tolerates normal gaps between a completed session and prompt re-dispatch.

`hooks` run lifecycle commands around worktree creation, agent execution, and
cleanup. Treat them as trusted code: they run with the Detent process
permissions and should be short, deterministic, and safe to retry.

### Intake, retrospectives, routines, and admission

`intake.sources` turns webhook or scheduled external signals into tracker
items. `retro` periodically mines completed work for recurring operational
lessons. `routines` schedules arbitrary agent prompts against supported
trackers.

`backlog_admission` is an opt-in scheduled pass that evaluates items from
configured source states against a named criteria section in `WORKFLOW.md`,
then proposes a bounded number for a target state. Its five-field cron,
source-state membership, distinct target state, tracker support, and positive
run limits are enforced by the same validators that feed the generated table
below. When `require_effort` is enabled, `effort_section` names a separate
project-owned `WORKFLOW.md` rubric whose bold or code-formatted list items
define the allowed recommendations. Detent writes a recommended `detent-agent`
block before the admission transition only when the issue has no existing
block; the default remains disabled for compatibility.

Admission screens out non-deliverable tracker and intake artifacts before the
agent run. Add `<!-- detent:no-dispatch -->` to an issue body for a deterministic
operator opt-out. The decline remains in the configured source state, is
commented once, and is reconsidered only after the title or body changes.

When enabled, admission defaults to `*/15 * * * *`, which limits normal
candidate wait time to 15 minutes. An every-30-minute schedule implies up to 30
minutes of latency, an hourly schedule up to one hour, and a daily schedule up
to 24 hours. Restricting a daily schedule to weekdays creates a 72-hour weekend
gap. A slow schedule is valid, but it can make admission look broken because
issues accumulate in the source state while Detent is simply waiting for the
next run.

On the host used to establish the default, 20 admission runs and 18 admission
agent sessions averaged about 25 seconds of wall time per run and 36,000 tokens
per candidate-bearing run, with 655,368 tokens total. Runs with no eligible
candidates are cheaper because they do not start an admission agent. At the
15-minute default, there are at most 96 runs per day; use `detent doctor` to
compare your schedule with recent candidate-bearing runs and the runtime and
token cost observed on your own host. Choose a slower explicit schedule when
that latency/cost tradeoff is intentional.

The onboarding workflow builder accepts a named `INTAKE_PROFILE` and expands
these `answers.env` keys into the typed configuration below. The generated
field reference remains derived from the YAML schema; this table documents the
interview-to-config mapping that exists before YAML is rendered.

## Fleet staleness warnings

`observability.staleness` detects work items that exceed lane-specific aging
thresholds, non-empty dispatch or merge queues that stop advancing, and
repeated identical scheduler decisions. Lane residency starts at the most
recent entry. Repeated entries can still raise a cumulative warning when their
residency exceeds the lane threshold within
`observability.staleness.lane_reentry_window_hours`. Human-gate lanes emit one
reminder at their threshold, then remain quiet until the lane changes or
`observability.staleness.human_gate_rearm_hours` passes. Sticky breaker and
operator parks with a recorded cause are excluded from lane aging because the
Blocked lane already carries their operator signal. A `park_cause_stale`
warning replaces lane aging when recorded evidence is cleared or can no longer
be verified.

Operator-facing warnings use the same authorization selector as board and
runtime rows. Item warnings outside that selector are excluded before they are
logged, delivered, or counted. Project-level liveness warnings are computed
from authorized dispatch and merge queues. Repeated decisions about the
authorization boundary itself, including `authorization_selector_declined`,
remain visible even when the affected item is out of scope because the selector
decision is the condition the operator must correct.

A Blocked item observed from tracker state without a recorded blocker cause is
classified as `blocked, cause unrecorded`. The card keeps that classification
beside its lane provenance, and an eventual lane-aging warning names the missing
cause and the remedy instead of presenting an unexplained generic Blocked age.

The repeated-decision detector considers only current, non-terminal items.
Closed and merged items and items in a configured terminal state are excluded.
`observability.staleness.repeated_decision_benign_reasons` lists scheduler
reasons that represent healthy waits rather than operator-actionable stalls.
Its defaults cover active workers, dependency waits, global-capacity waits, and
GitHub REST pacing. Set the list explicitly to replace those defaults for a
project. Values must exactly match a scheduler-emitted reason. Configuration
validation reports the configured value and the emitted reason set when they do
not match; for example, `unauthorized` does not match
`authorization_selector_declined`. This validation is also surfaced by
`detent doctor` during config resolution.

The detector evaluates decisions inside
`observability.staleness.repeated_window_hours`, but the orchestrator retains
only the 500 most recent scheduler decisions. Its effective history is
therefore whichever is smaller: the configured time window or the retained
500-decision sample.

Warnings appear in the dashboard, `/health`, and `detent doctor`. Configure
`observability.staleness.webhook.url` to push each newly active warning as a
`detent.staleness.warning` JSON event. The payload includes a stable warning ID,
the affected project or item, the reason, and age and threshold values in
seconds. A delivered warning is not sent again on every scheduler tick. A
dashboard dismissal persists until the warning condition changes, such as a
new lane entry or a new scheduler cause.

## Unstarted GitHub checks

`tracker.github_unstarted_check_threshold_seconds` controls when a GitHub check
that remains queued without a `started_at` timestamp appears as unstarted. The
15-minute default is intentionally non-zero because a cold or busy runner pool
can legitimately take several minutes to pick up a job; setting the threshold
too low would turn ordinary queueing into an operator-facing signal.

## Codex deliverable elicitation

`codex.deliverable_elicitation_allowlist` declares exact MCP mutation tuples
that an unattended Codex worker may confirm for its configured deliverable. The
same field is available under `agents.backends[].options` for a routed Codex
backend. It defaults to an empty list. Each entry requires `server`, `tool`, and
`repository`; server-only entries are invalid.

```yaml
codex:
  approval_policy: never
  deliverable_elicitation_allowlist:
    - server: codex_apps
      tool: github.create_pull_request
      repository: digitaldrywood/detent
    - server: codex_apps
      tool: github.update_pull_request
      repository: digitaldrywood/detent
    - server: codex_apps
      tool: github.add_comment_to_issue
      repository: digitaldrywood/detent
    - server: codex_apps
      tool: github.update_issue_comment
      repository: digitaldrywood/detent
    - server: codex_apps
      tool: github.update_issue
      repository: digitaldrywood/detent
    - server: codex_apps
      tool: github.create_issue
      repository: digitaldrywood/detent
```

The allowlist is a narrow exception to `codex.approval_policy`, not a broader
approval mode. With either `never` or `on-request`, Detent accepts an MCP
elicitation only when it correlates to exactly one pending tool call on the
same server, thread, and turn; the correlated tool is a supported workflow
deliverable mutation; and both its repository argument and the corresponding
active work-item repository match the configured tuple. Pull-request mutations
match the linked pull-request repository. Issue and Workpad mutations match the
tracked issue repository and are accepted only when it is also the deliverable
repository. Detent declines these direct Codex issue mutations when the linked
pull request belongs to another repository because MCP elicitation cannot
rewrite the already-pending arguments through the visibility-aware publication
protector. Connector-backed issue writes remain available and apply that
protector before sending content. Pull-request and issue creation and updates use
`repository_full_name`; issue comment creation and updates use
`repo_full_name`. Missing or ambiguous correlation, other mutation tools
including `github.delete_issue`, and repository mismatches are declined.
Command, file-change, permission, and user-input requests retain their existing
handling.

Allowlisting `github.create_issue` authorizes issue creation only on the
workflow's own tracked repository. This supports workers filing scoped issues
they discover while delivering the current work item; it does not authorize
issue deletion, transfer, or creation in any other repository. Those mutations
remain non-deliverable.

Allowlisting `github.update_issue` permits its full exposed mutation surface:
title, body, state, assignees, milestone, and labels may all be replaced. The
allowlist correlates and constrains the repository, but does not constrain the
other approved arguments.

With `approval_policy: never` and an empty allowlist, non-browser MCP
elicitations are declined exactly as before. `chrome-devtools` empty-form tool
approval remains a separate built-in behavior and is unchanged by this list.

## Generated field reference

The generated block reflects the YAML-tagged Go structs reachable from the
project config. It reads effective defaults through the real normalization
path and derives validation text by exercising boundary values through the
real loader and validators. “None” means no field-level rule was surfaced;
subsystem interactions can still constrain a value.

Run `go generate ./...` after changing the config structs, defaults, or
validators. `make check` compares the committed generated artifacts with fresh
rendering and fails on drift.

`budget.per_issue_max_usd` and `agent.budget.per_issue_max_usd` are
estimate-based admission backstops, not mid-session spend ceilings. Detent
checks cumulative issue spend plus a preflight session estimate before starting
the agent. Actual session cost can exceed that estimate and the configured
backstop. Once the next projected dispatch would exceed the backstop, Detent
parks the issue on a hard hold until an operator raises or disables the cap, or
explicitly retries after resetting the hold. `refusal_cooldown_seconds` applies
only to resettable budget pacing and never clears a per-issue hard hold.
